# Session Summary - October 30, 2025 (Final)

## Issues Resolved Today

### 1️⃣ **Plotly Charts Rendering as JSON** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Agent generated Plotly charts but they displayed as raw JSON text in the chat
- Users saw: `{"data":[{"marker":{"color":...}}}` instead of an interactive chart

**Solution:**
- Created `extract_and_render_plotly()` function in `src/ui/app.py`
- Detects Plotly JSON in agent responses (with "data" and "layout" keys)
- Uses `st.plotly_chart()` to render interactively
- Removes JSON from text display, avoiding duplication

**Result:**
- ✅ Charts render beautifully in the chat
- ✅ Users see interactive Plotly charts with hover info
- ✅ Clean markdown text below charts

---

### 2️⃣ **Report Download Links Showing Blank Pages** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
```
User: "Gere relatório de validação em CSV"
Agent: "Arquivo em http://localhost:8501/reports/issues_by_type_20251030_101329.xlsx"
User clicks link
Result: Blank page 😞
```

**Root Cause:**
- Streamlit doesn't have routes to serve static files from custom directories
- Visiting `/reports/{filename}` on the Streamlit server doesn't work

**Solution - Multi-layered Approach:**

**Layer 1: Automatic File Detection** (Primary)
- New `extract_file_downloads()` function detects filenames in chat
- Looks for pattern: `{name}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}.{ext}`
- Finds actual files on disk in `./reports/`
- Creates Streamlit download buttons automatically

**Layer 2: Optional HTTP Server** (Fallback)
- New `src/ui/file_server.py` provides Flask-based HTTP server
- Runs on port 5000 if needed for external access
- Not required for normal chat operation
- Provides `/download/{filename}` endpoint

**Result:**
```
User: "Gere relatório de validação em CSV"
Agent: "Arquivo em issues_by_type_20251030_101329.xlsx"
[Streamlit detects filename]
Result: 📊 Download button appears
User clicks button
Result: File downloads instantly! 🎉
```

## Code Changes

### File 1: `src/ui/app.py`

**Lines Added: ~100**

```python
# 1. New imports for file handling
import json
import re
from pathlib import Path

# 2. New function: extract_file_downloads()
def extract_file_downloads(response_text: str) -> tuple[str, list]:
    """
    Extract file paths from response and return remaining text + file list.
    Detects files matching pattern: {name}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}.{ext}
    """
    # ... implementation ...

# 3. Enhanced extract_and_render_plotly()
def extract_and_render_plotly(response_text: str) -> str:
    """
    Extract Plotly JSON and render with st.plotly_chart()
    Smart brace matching to find JSON boundaries
    """
    # ... implementation ...

# 4. Chat display updated
# Display chat history:
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        remaining_text = extract_and_render_plotly(message["content"])
        remaining_text, files = extract_file_downloads(remaining_text)
        
        if remaining_text:
            st.markdown(remaining_text)
        
        if files:
            # Render download buttons
            for file_info in files:
                st.download_button(...)

# 5. Agent response handling updated
# Same process for new responses from agent
```

### File 2: `src/ui/file_server.py` (NEW)

**Lines: ~120**

```python
"""Simple file server for report downloads."""
from flask import Flask, send_file, abort
from pathlib import Path

class ReportFileServer:
    """Serve report files from the reports directory."""
    
    def __init__(self, reports_dir: str = "./reports"):
        self.reports_dir = Path(reports_dir)
        self.app = Flask(__name__)
        self._register_routes()
    
    def _register_routes(self):
        @self.app.route('/download/<filename>')
        def download_file(filename: str):
            # Security checks + file serving
            ...
    
    def run(self, host: str = "127.0.0.1", port: int = 5000):
        self.app.run(host=host, port=port)
```

### File 3: `requirements.txt`

**Added:**
```
flask>=3.0.0
```

## Architecture Comparison

### Streamlit's Limitations ⚠️
```
HTTP GET /reports/file.xlsx
    ↓
Streamlit Router
    ├─ /health ✓
    ├─ /api/* ✓
    ├─ /stream/* ✓
    └─ /reports/* ✗ (NOT HANDLED)
    ↓
Result: 404 or Blank Page
```

### New Solution ✅
```
Agent Response with Filename
    ↓
extract_file_downloads()
    ├─ Detect: "file_20251030_101329.xlsx"
    ├─ Find: ./reports/file_20251030_101329.xlsx
    └─ Exists: True ✓
    ↓
st.download_button()
    ├─ Label: "📊 Download file_..."
    ├─ Data: Read from disk
    └─ MIME: Detect from extension
    ↓
User Click
    ↓
Browser Download (Native)
    ✓ Works immediately
    ✓ No server needed
    ✓ Correct file type
```
