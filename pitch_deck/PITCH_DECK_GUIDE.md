## üí° Final Tips

1. **Be authentic.** Tell your story. People invest in people.
2. **Listen more than you talk.** Let the other person drive the conversation.
3. **Focus on their problem, not your solution.** Lead with empathy.
4. **Numbers tell stories.** Use metrics to paint the picture.
5. **Know when to walk away.** Not every investor/customer is right fit.
6. **Iterate quickly.** Get feedback, improve, repeat.
7. **Keep momentum.** Follow up immediately, stay top of mind.
8. **Build relationships.** Even rejections can lead to future deals.
